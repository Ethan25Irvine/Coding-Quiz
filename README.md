# Coding-Quiz


This was by far the hardest homework. I don't know if I wasn't looking up/asking the right questions or if it was because I had very little time compared to other weeks to do it but this assignment definetly was a wake up call to get my act together and not procrastinate as much. More than likely going to come back and get a better grade for this assignment but for now I am mentally drained and just have no urge to keep going on this.
